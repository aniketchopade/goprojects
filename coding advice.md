# Coding advice

## If you have an error in a Go function, either log it or return it, do not do both unless you have a really good reason for doing so!
## Go interfaces define behaviors, not data and data structures.
## Use the io.Reader and io.Writer interfaces because they make your code more extensible.
## Make sure that you pass a pointer to a variable of a function only when needed.The rest of the time, just pass the value of the variable.Error variables are not string variables; they are error variables!Do not test your Go code on production machines!
## If you don't really know a Go feature, test it before using it for the first time, especially if you are developing an application or a utility that will be used by a large number of users.
## If you are afraid of making mistakes, you will most likely end up doing nothing really useful! So, experiment as much as you can!
